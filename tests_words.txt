3 sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary . 
4 compelling revenge thriller , though somewhat weakened by a miscast leading lady . 
3 though it draws several decent laughs , it 's low-cal woody at best . 
3 manages to be original , even though it rips off many of its ideas . 
2 though everything might be literate and smart , it never took off and always seemed static . 
3 though this film can be clumsy , its ambitions are equally -- and admirably -- uncommercial . 
4 it 's all very cute , though not terribly funny if you 're more than six years old . 
3 though certainly original in form , altar boys requires a taste for swamp thing-type animation , doubled with a deafening score . 
4 though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work . 
2 somewhere short of tremors on the modern b-scene : neither as funny nor as clever , though an agreeably unpretentious way to spend ninety minutes . 
4 though the film 's scenario is certainly not earthshaking , this depiction of fluctuating female sexuality has two winning lead performances and charm to spare . 
4 i do n't know precisely what to make of steven soderbergh 's full frontal , though that did n't stop me from enjoying much of it . 
2 though avary has done his best to make something out of ellis ' nothing novel , in the end , his rules is barely worth following . 
3 though the plot is predictable , the movie never feels formulaic , because the attention is on the nuances of the emotional development of the delicate characters . 
4 though the controversial korean filmmaker 's latest effort is not for all tastes , it offers gorgeous imagery , effective performances , and an increasingly unsettling sense of foreboding . 
2 though ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there 's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention . 
4 though it is by no means his best work , laissez-passer is a distinguished and distinctive effort by a bona-fide master , a fascinating film replete with rewards to be had by all willing to make the effort to reap them . 
4 though mama takes a bit too long to find its rhythm and a third-act plot development is somewhat melodramatic , its ribald humor and touching nostalgia are sure to please anyone in search of a jules and jim for the new millennium . 
2 though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter . 
4 although it 's a bit smug and repetitive , this documentary engages your brain in a way few current films do . 
3 the crime matters less than the characters , although the filmmakers supply enough complications , close calls and double-crosses to satisfy us . 
4 although it bangs a very cliched drum at times , this crowd-pleaser 's fresh dialogue , energetic music , and good-natured spunk are often infectious . 
2 although trying to balance self-referential humor and a normal ol' slasher plot seemed like a decent endeavor , the result does n't fully satisfy either the die-hard jason fans or those who can take a good joke . 
3 part comedy , part drama , the movie winds up accomplishing neither in full , and leaves us feeling touched and amused by several moments and ideas , but nevertheless dissatisfied with the movie as a whole . 
2 we are left with a superficial snapshot that , however engaging , is insufficiently enlightening and inviting . 
2 safe conduct , however ambitious and well-intentioned , fails to hit the entertainment bull 's - eye . 
2 however , it lacks grandeur and that epic quality often associated with stevenson 's tale as well as with earlier disney efforts . 
3 effective but too-tepid biopic 
3 enduring love but exhausting cinema . 
3 faultlessly professional but finally slight . 
2 frenetic but not really funny . 
2 creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller . 
3 sometimes smart but more often sophomoric . 
2 an intermittently pleasing but mostly routine effort . 
4 dark and disturbing , but also surprisingly funny . 
3 flawed but worthy look at life in u.s. relocation camps . 
5 somewhat blurred , but kinnear 's performance is razor sharp . 
3 admirable , certainly , but not much fun to watch . 
2 the fight scenes are fun , but it grows tedious . 
2 flat , but with a revelatory performance by michelle williams . 
3 it wo n't rock any boats but is solid meat-and-potatoes filmmaking . 
5 awkward but sincere and , ultimately , it wins you over . 
2 involving at times , but lapses quite casually into the absurd . 
3 a well-made , thoughtful , well-acted clunker , but a clunker nonetheless . 
2 aspires for the piquant but only really achieves a sort of ridiculous sourness . 
4 all but the most persnickety preteens should enjoy this nonthreatening but thrilling adventure . 
1 marisa tomei is good , but just a kiss is just a mess . 
1 but here 's the real damn : it is n't funny , either . 
3 it 's fun , but the code-talk will fly right over everyone 's head 
3 occasionally amateurishly made but a winsome cast and nice dialogue keeps it going . 
2 all ends well , sort of , but the frenzied comic moments never click . 
2 fine acting but there is no sense of connecting the dots , just dots . 
3 human resources was a good , straightforward tale , but time out is better . 
5 tadpole is a sophisticated , funny and good-natured treat , slight but a pleasure . 
3 the cast is uniformly excellent ... but the film itself is merely mildly charming . 
4 this version 's no classic like its predecessor , but its pleasures are still plentiful . 
3 this 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it 's a tad slow . 
4 a carefully structured scream of consciousness that is tortured and unsettling -- but unquestionably alive . 
2 it delivers some chills and sustained unease , but flounders in its quest for deeper meaning . 
2 there 's an audience for it , but it could have been funnier and more innocent . 
2 sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution . 
3 it 's got its heart in the right place , but it also wilts after awhile . 
5 it 's a good film -- not a classic , but odd , entertaining and authentic . 
4 an uneven but intriguing drama that is part homage and part remake of the italian masterpiece . 
4 far from perfect , but its heart is in the right place ... innocent and well-meaning . 
2 a very stylish but ultimately extremely silly tale ... a slick piece of nonsense but nothing more . 
2 the creaking , rusty ship makes a fine backdrop , but the ghosts ' haunting is routine . 
4 roman coppola may never become the filmmaker his dad was , but heck -- few filmmakers will . 
4 there are slow and repetitive parts , but it has just enough spice to keep it interesting . 
2 blessed with immense physical prowess he may well be , but ahola is simply not an actor . 
4 it 's predictable , but it jumps through the expected hoops with style and even some depth . 
4 tim story 's not there yet - but ` barbershop ' shows he 's on his way . 
2 plays as hollow catharsis , with lots of tears but very little in the way of insights . 
4 not everything works , but the average is higher than in mary and most other recent comedies . 
4 it is not a mass-market entertainment but an uncompromising attempt by one artist to think about another . 
2 the story is naturally poignant , but first-time screenwriter paul pender overloads it with sugary bits of business . 
2 it may be an easy swipe to take , but this barbershop just does n't make the cut . 
4 it 's not exactly a gourmet meal but the fare is fair , even coming from the drive-thru . 
5 this ecologically minded , wildlife friendly film teaches good ethics while entertaining with its unconventionally wacky but loving family 
3 the ending does leave you unfulfilled , but these are performances to enjoy in a memorable ensemble piece . 
4 intriguing and beautiful film , but those of you who read the book are likely to be disappointed . 
2 but an unwillingness to explore beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents nettelbeck 's film from coming together . 
3 the story is less vibrant , the jokes are a little lukewarm , but will anyone really care ? 
2 all that -lrb- powerpuff girls -rrb- charm is present in the movie , but it 's spread too thin . 
3 human nature initially succeeds by allowing itself to go crazy , but ultimately fails by spinning out of control . 
2 it does n't do the original any particular dishonor , but neither does it exude any charm or personality . 
2 starts off with a bang , but then fizzles like a wet stick of dynamite at the very end . 
1 the weight of water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire , but this leaky script barely stays afloat . 
1 spousal abuse is a major problem in contemporary society , but the film reduces this domestic tragedy to florid melodrama . 
4 it 's a humble effort , but spiced with wry humor and genuine pathos , especially between morgan and redgrave . 
2 fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters . 
5 waydowntown is by no means a perfect film , but its boasts a huge charm factor and smacks of originality . 
3 this is a good movie in spurts , but when it does n't work , it 's at important times . 
5 the film is all a little lit crit 101 , but it 's extremely well played and often very funny . 
4 reign of fire may be little more than another platter of reheated aliens , but it 's still pretty tasty . 
2 absorbing and disturbing -- perhaps more disturbing than originally intended -- but a little clarity would have gone a long way . 
3 a reasonably efficient mechanism , but it offers few surprises and finds its stars slumming in territory they should have avoided . 
2 -lrb- director -rrb- byler may yet have a great movie in him , but charlotte sometimes is only half of one . 
3 the movie addresses a hungry need for pg-rated , nonthreatening family movies , but it does n't go too much further . 
3 a journey that 's too random and inconclusive to be compelling , but which hoffman 's brilliance almost makes worth taking . 
2 begins as a promising meditation on one of america 's most durable obsessions but winds up as a slender cinematic stunt . 
4 too bad , but thanks to some lovely comedic moments and several fine performances , it 's not a total loss . 
2 scarlet diva has a voyeuristic tug , but all in all it 's a lot less sensational than it wants to be . 
4 de niro and mcdormand give solid performances , but their screen time is sabotaged by the story 's inability to create interest . 
1 meandering , sub-aquatic mess : it 's so bad it 's good , but only if you slide in on a freebie . 
2 son of the bride may be a good half-hour too long but comes replete with a flattering sense of mystery and quietness . 
2 none of this violates the letter of behan 's book , but missing is its spirit , its ribald , full-throated humor . 
3 it does n't quite work , but there 's enough here to make us look forward to the russos ' next offering . 
4 narc may not get an ` a ' for originality , but it wears its b-movie heritage like a badge of honor . 
4 it is ridiculous , of course ... but it is also refreshing , disarming , and just outright enjoyable despite its ridiculousness . 
4 not for everyone , but for those with whom it will connect , it 's a nice departure from standard moviegoing fare . 
3 it 's fun , but a psychological mess , with austin powers bumping his head on the way out of the closet . 
2 human nature talks the talk , but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the merely quirky from the surreal . 
3 sure , it 's more of the same , but as the film proves , that 's not always a bad thing . 
3 the new faces are interesting , but the old story is n't , especially when it starts to seem more improvised than scripted . 
5 the story may not be new , but australian director john polson , making his american feature debut , jazzes it up adroitly . 
4 still pretentious and filled with subtext , but entertaining enough at ` face value ' to recommend to anyone looking for something different . 
4 jason x has cheesy effects and a hoary plot , but its macabre , self-deprecating sense of humor makes up for a lot . 
3 morrissette 's script and direction show a fair amount of intelligence and wit -- but it does n't signify a whole lot either . 
2 acting , particularly by tambor , almost makes `` never again '' worthwhile , but -lrb- writer\/director -rrb- schaeffer should follow his titular advice 
3 the additional storyline is interesting and entertaining , but it does n't have the same magical quality as the beginning of the story . 
1 some of seagal 's action pictures are guilty pleasures , but this one is so formulaic that it seems to be on auto-pilot . 
3 i enjoyed time of favor while i was watching it , but i was surprised at how quickly it faded from my memory . 
3 it 's an earnest debut full of heartfelt performances , but is ultimately let down by a story that is all too predictable . 
3 morton is a great actress portraying a complex character , but morvern callar grows less compelling the farther it meanders from its shocking start . 
5 disney 's live-action division has a history of releasing cinematic flotsam , but this is one occasion when they have unearthed a rare gem . 
3 it is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie ... but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made eurotrash cult object . 
4 do n't plan on the perfect ending , but sweet home alabama hits the mark with critics who escaped from a small town life . 
2 the film meant well in its horse tale about freedom , but was n't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing . 
2 there are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust . 
2 it 's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold . 
3 drives for the same kind of bittersweet , conciliatory tone that three seasons achieved but loses its way in rhetorical excess and blatant sentimentality . 
3 the movie is too cute to take itself too seriously , but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students . 
4 a somewhat crudely constructed but gripping , questing look at a person so racked with self-loathing , he becomes an enemy to his own race . 
4 so many documentaries like this presuppose religious bigotry or zealous nuttiness of its antagonists , but family fundamentals displays a rare gift for unflinching impartiality . 
2 -lrb- it 's -rrb- a prison soccer movie starring charismatic tough guy vinnie jones , but it had too much spitting for me to enjoy . 
2 as a revenge thriller , the movie is serviceable , but it does n't really deliver the delicious guilty pleasure of the better film versions . 
2 has a plot full of twists upon knots ... and a nonstop parade of mock-tarantino scuzbag types that starts out clever but veers into overkill . 
1 too much of this well-acted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger , more complicated story , one that never materializes . 
3 lilia 's transformation from strict mother to sensual siren is superficially preposterous , but abbas infuses the role with an unimpeachable core of emotional truth . 
4 the pleasures of super troopers may be fleeting , but they 'll register strongly with anybody who still retains a soft spot for precollegiate humor . 
4 who knows what exactly godard is on about in this film , but his words and images do n't have to add up to mesmerize you . 
3 not as distinctive or even as humorous as its needs to be to stand out , but it has clearly been made with affection and care . 
5 often gruelling and heartbreaking to witness , but seldahl and wollter 's sterling performances raise this far above the level of the usual maudlin disease movie . 
2 at first , the sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious , but as the film goes on , the joke wears thin . 
4 painful to watch , but viewers willing to take a chance will be rewarded with two of the year 's most accomplished and riveting film performances . 
2 if you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce . 
2 ray liotta and jason patric do some of their best work in their underwritten roles , but do n't be fooled : nobody deserves any prizes here . 
2 nair stuffs the film with dancing , henna , ornamentation , and group song , but her narrative clichés and telegraphed episodes smell of old soap opera . 
4 not a cozy or ingratiating work , but it 's challenging , sometimes clever , and always interesting , and those are reasons enough to see it . 
4 day is not a great bond movie , but it is a good bond movie , which still makes it much better than your typical bond knock-offs . 
2 accuracy and realism are terrific , but if your film becomes boring , and your dialogue is n't smart , then you need to use more poetic license . 
3 chalk it up to my adoration for both de niro and murphy , but i had a pretty good time with this movie - despite its myriad flaws . 
4 if it tried to do anything more , it would fail and perhaps explode , but at this level of manic whimsy , it is just about right . 
2 the plot is very clever , but boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of . 
3 a sly game of cat and mouse that 's intense and thrilling at times , but occasionally stretches believability to its limits and relies on predictable plot contrivances . 
2 the movie feels like it 's going to be great , and it carries on feeling that way for a long time , but takeoff just never happens . 
3 it will probably prove interesting to ram dass fans , but to others it may feel like a parody of the mellow , peace-and-love side of the '60s counterculture . 
3 literally nothing in the pool is new , but if you grew up on the stalker flicks of the 1980 's this one should appease you for 90 minutes . 
5 i complain all the time about seeing the same ideas repeated in films over and over again , but the bourne identity proves that a fresh take is always possible . 
3 parker probably thinks he 's shaking up a classic the way kenneth branagh and baz luhrmann have , but this half-hearted messing-about just makes us miss wilde 's still-contemporary play . 
2 stars matthew perry and elizabeth hurley illicit more than a chuckle , and more jokes land than crash , but ultimately serving sara does n't distinguish itself from the herd . 
3 both stars manage to be funny , but , like the recent i spy , the star chemistry begs the question of whether random gags add up to a movie . 
2 there are touching moments in etoiles , but for the most part this is a dull , dour documentary on what ought to be a joyful or at least fascinating subject . 
3 beers , who , when she 's given the right lines , can charm the paint off the wall ... -lrb- but -rrb- the script goes wrong at several key junctures . 
3 viewed on its own terms , treasure planet is better-than-average family entertainment , but true fans of the stevenson 's novel will likely prefer disney 's more faithful 1950 live-action swashbuckling classic . 
4 is n't quite the equal of woo 's best earlier work , but it 's easily his finest american film ... comes close to recapturing the brilliance of his hong kong films . 
2 the period -- swinging london in the time of the mods and the rockers -- gets the once-over once again in gangster no. 1 , but falls apart long before the end . 
3 each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception . 
5 divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood may not be exactly divine , but it 's definitely -- defiantly -- ya ya , what with all of those terrific songs and spirited performances . 
4 time changer may not be the most memorable cinema session but its profound self-evaluation message about our fragile existence and the absence of spiritual guidance should at least invade an abundance of mindsets 
3 maybe it 's just because this past year has seen the release of some of the worst film comedies in decades ... but honestly , analyze that really is n't all that bad . 
4 this may not have the dramatic gut-wrenching impact of other holocaust films , but it 's a compelling story , mainly because of the way it 's told by the people who were there . 
4 we can see the wheels turning , and we might resent it sometimes , but this is still a nice little picture , made by bright and friendly souls with a lot of good cheer . 
2 there 's plenty of style in guillermo del toro 's sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply ca n't sustain more than 90 minutes . 
4 it uses an old-time formula , it 's not terribly original and it 's rather messy -- but you just have to love the big , dumb , happy movie my big fat greek wedding . 
2 the filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point , unless it 's that life stinks , especially for sensitive married women who really love other women . 
2 this goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring 
4 it 's a decent glimpse into a time period , and an outcast , that is no longer accessible , but it does n't necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor . 
5 it 's rare to find a film that dazzles the eye , challenges the brain , and satisfies our lust for fast-paced action , but minority report delivers all that and a whole lot more . 
2 writer\/director john mckay ignites some charming chemistry between kate and jed but , when he veers into sodden melodrama , punctuated by violins , it 's disastrous and kate 's jealous female friends become downright despicable . 
3 the final result makes for adequate entertainment , i suppose , but anyone who has seen chicago on stage will leave the theater feeling they 've watched nothing but a pale imitation of the real deal . 
3 it 's a deeply serious movie that cares passionately about its subject , but too often becomes ponderous in its teaching of history , or lost in the intricate connections and multiple timelines of its story . 
2 the overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there 's still a real sense that the star trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction . 
4 there are as many misses as hits , but ultimately , it finds humor in the foibles of human behavior , and it 's a welcome return to the roots of a genre that should depend on surprises . 
3 yes , 4ever is harmless in the extreme and it 'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to spirited away ? 
2 this is a great subject for a movie , but hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director john woo has built his career on . 
3 baran is n't the most transporting or gripping film from iran -- or , indeed , by its director -- but it 's a worthy companion to the many fine , focused films emerging from that most surprising of nations . 
4 there are times when a rumor of angels plays like an extended episode of touched by an angel -- a little too much dancing , a few too many weeping scenes -- but i liked its heart and its spirit . 
2 there 's no denying the elaborateness of the artist 's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity . 
2 with a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of los angeles , where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble , the dogwalker has a few characters and ideas , but it never manages to put them on the same path . 
4 its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar , but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and , at the same time , is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time . 
2 like mike does n't win any points for originality . 
3 the movie is n't always easy to look at . 
1 wait for video -- and then do n't rent it . 
4 there is n't a weak or careless performance amongst them . 
1 this is n't a `` friday '' worth waiting for . 
2 it will come as no surprise that the movie is n't scary . 
5 it represents better-than-average movie-making that does n't demand a dumb , distracted audience . 
2 i did n't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot . 
1 but here 's the real damn : it is n't funny , either . 
1 it would n't be my preferred way of spending 100 minutes or $ 7.00 . 
3 it 's a sometimes interesting remake that does n't compare to the brilliant original . 
5 it 's a movie -- and an album -- you wo n't want to miss . 
2 beyond a handful of mildly amusing lines ... there just is n't much to laugh at . 
3 it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it is n't . 
4 this is n't my favorite in the series , still i enjoyed it enough to recommend . 
2 a mixed bag of a comedy that ca n't really be described as out of this world . 
2 it 's a film that hinges on its casting , and glover really does n't fit the part . 
1 obstacles are too easily overcome and there is n't much in the way of character development in the script . 
4 sound the trumpets : for the first time since desperately seeking susan , madonna does n't suck as an actress . 
1 for me , this opera is n't a favorite , so it 's a long time before the fat lady sings .
